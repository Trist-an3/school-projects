This folder is a collection of assignments i did in my CSE130 System Design class

Each project focuses on the principles of computer systems design, including file management, memory handling, networking, concurrency, and multithreaded server development.

* **File_Splitter:**
A program that reads files and splits them into lines based on a specified delimiter, focusing on file I/O and memory management.

* **Command_Line_Memory:**
A memory storage system allowing users to get and set file contents via the command line, with efficient memory management and error handling.

* **HTTP_Server:**
A basic HTTP server that handles client requests and serves files from the local system, focusing on networking and protocol implementation.

* **Concurrent_Data_Structures:**
Implements thread-safe data structures such as a bounded buffer and reader-writer lock, designed to handle synchronization in a multithreaded environment.

* **Multi_Threaded_HTTP_Server:**
A multithreaded version of the HTTP server that handles concurrent client requests, focusing on thread management and synchronization.
