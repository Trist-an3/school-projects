Each project focuses on the implementation and application of fundamental data structures 

* **List_ADT:**
Implements a doubly linked list ADT with cursor-based navigation.

* **Graph_ADT_BFS:**
A graph ADT implementing Breadth-First Search (BFS) for graph traversal.

* **Graph_ADT_DFS:**
A graph ADT implementing Depth-First Search (DFS) for graph traversal.

* **Sparse_Matrix_Calculator:**
A program that performs operations on sparse matrices using efficient storage techniques.

* **Deck_Shuffler_List_ADT:**
Simulates a deck shuffling algorithm using a list ADT.

* **Large_Integer_Operations_ADT:**
Implements large integer operations such as addition and multiplication using an ADT.

* **Binary_Search_Tree_Dictionary:**
A binary search tree (BST) used to store and look up key-value pairs.

* **Red_Black_Tree_Dictionary:**
Implements a red-black tree for balanced key-value storage and retrieval.
