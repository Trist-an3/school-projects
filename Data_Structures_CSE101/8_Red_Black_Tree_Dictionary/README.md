## Purpose:
    The purpose of this assignment is to create a program that implements the Dictionary ADT using
    a Red-Black Tree (RBT). The program reads a file containing unique strings,

    two different representations of this data: Alphabetical Representation and Pre-order Tree Walk
    Representation

## Files included
    Exectuable Files:
    DictionaryTest.cpp - Testing file for Dictionary ADT functions
    Order.cpp - Top level client for performing the sorting representations
    WordFrequency.cpp - Top level client for converting each word to lowercase and place as a key in Dictionary

    ADT Files:
    Dictionary.cpp - Dictionary ADT functions

    Header Files:
    Dictionary.h - Header file for the Dictionary ADT functions

    Extras:
    Makefile - Compiles and creates executables
    README.md - Markdown that explains what the heck is going on

## Extra Notes
* For the Dictionary.cpp file
    * Some of the code is based off Professor Tantalo's example code and 
    pseudocode from the class webage under examples
