## Purpose:
    This assignment involves building an Integer List ADT to indirectly sort lines from an input 
    file in lexicographic order. Using a doubly linked list, the program creates a list of indices 
    to represent the sorted order of the strings and outputs the sorted lines to an output file 
    without modifying the original array.

## Files included
    Exectuable Files:
    List.c -  File for ADT functions 
    Lex.c - Main file 
    ListTest.cpp - Testing file 

    ADT Files:
    List.c - List ADT functions

    Header Files:
    List.h -  Header file for the List ADTs

    Extras:
    Makefile - Compiles and creates executables
    README.md - Makdown that explains what the heck is going on
