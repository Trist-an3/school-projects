    GraphTest.c -  File to test individual functions 
    FindComponents.c - Main file to strongly connect components based on graph in input file

    ADT Files:
    List.c - List ADT functions
    Graph.c - Graph ADT functions

    Header Files:
    Graph.h - Header file for the Graph ADTs
    List.h -  Header file for the List ADTs

    Extras:
    Makefile - Compiles and creates executables

## Extra Notes
* For the List.c file, its from the PA1 List.c file
* For the Graph.c file, its from' PA2 but adjustments were made
    * removed some functions and added some new ones
