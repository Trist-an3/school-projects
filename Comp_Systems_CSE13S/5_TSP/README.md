## Purpose:
    Graph theory for tsp and focuses on implementing depth-first search (DFS), stacks, 
    and pathfinding algorithms to optimize the route efficiently

## Files included
    Exectuable Files:
    tsp.c - main file

    Source Files:
    graph.c - Implements the Graph ADT used to store vertices and edges, represented as an adjacency matrix.
    stack.c - Implements a stack data structure to manage the DFS traversal.
    path.c - Implements the Path ADT used to store and track the current travel path and its total weight.

    Helper file:
    graph.h - Declares the interface for the Graph ADT.
    stack.h - Declares the interface for the Stack ADT.
    path.h - Declares the interface for the Path ADT.
    vertices.h - Specifies the start vertex for the TSP route.

    Extras:
    Makefile - Compiles and creates executables
