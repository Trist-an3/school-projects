## Purpose:
    This project involves developing a C program to simulate deuteranopia 
    (red-green color blindness) by altering the color palette of BMP images.

## Files included
    Exectuable Files:
    colorb.c - Contains the main program logic to process the BMP images and simulate deuteranopia.

    Source Files:
    bmp.c - Implements functions to read, write, and manipulate BMP files.
    io.c - Handles binary file I/O operations, including reading and writing integer data types in little-endian format.

    Testing File:
    iotest.c - Contains tests for the I/O functions to ensure correct reading and writing of binary data.

    Helper file:
    bmp.h - Declares the BMP image structure and associated functions.
    io.h - Declares the I/O functions used for binary file reading and writing.

    Extras:
    Makefile - Compiles and creates executables
