This folder is a collection of assignments i did in my CSE13S C Computer Programming

Each project explores different aspects of systems programming, file I/O, memory management, and algorithm design in C.

* **Pass the Pigs:**
Simulates the game "Pass the Pigs". Focuses on randomization, file input/output, and implementing the game logic in a command-line environment.

* **Hangman Game:**
Builds the classic word game "Hangman" using strings and arrays. Handles input validation, string manipulation, and game state tracking.

* **RPN Calculator:**
Implements a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator, focusing on stack data structures and function pointers for evaluating mathematical expressions.

* **Set Operations and Sorting Algorithms:**
Develops set operations using bitwise manipulation and implements several sorting algorithms, including Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Heapsort, and Quicksort. It also compares the performance of these algorithms.

* **Travelling Salesman Problem:**
Solves the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using graph theory and depth-first search. Focuses on efficient pathfinding algorithms to optimize travel routes.

* **Color Blindness Simulator:**
A C program that simulates red-green color blindness (deuteranopia) by manipulating the color palette of BMP images. Involves file I/O and basic image processing techniques.

* **Huffman Coding:**
Implements Huffman Coding for compressing and decompressing files. Uses binary trees and bit-level operations to optimize data storage based on symbol frequency.
