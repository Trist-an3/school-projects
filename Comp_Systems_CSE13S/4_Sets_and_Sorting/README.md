## Purpose:
    This project focuses on implementing set operations using bitwise manipulation 
    and developing four sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Heapsort, and more.

## Files included
    Exectuable Files:
    sorting.c - main file

    Source Files:
    stats.c - ADT functions
    set.c - Implements set operations using bitwise operators.
    insert.c - Implements Insertion Sort.
    shell.c - Implements Shell Sort using the Pratt sequence.
    heap.c - Implements Heapsort using a binary heap.
    quick.c - Implements recursive Quicksort.
    batcher.c - Contains the placeholder for Batcher Sort, which may or may not be implemented based on student choice.

    Helper file:
    set.h - Declares the set functions for bitwise operations.
    insert.h, shell.h, heap.h, quick.h, batcher.h - Declare the interfaces for the respective sorting algorithms.
    stats.h - Provides functions for tracking and reporting the number of moves and comparisons made during sorting.
    gaps.h - For the gap

    Extras:
    Makefile - Compiles and creates executables
